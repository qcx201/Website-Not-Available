## Website Not Available
Welcome to the rambles of a sleepless sleepy nobody at 3:32 AM. Allow me to congratulate you on this event in your life that is technically happening and perhaps even true, though completely meaningless and insigificant.

This is the mission:
1. Learn how to make a website (cheaply, if possible).

2. Throw misguided, half-baked ideas unto a website--as you would throw unto the sink a cake made from scratch that came out of the oven suddenly disappointing, or would a wet wad of toilet paper onto the wall, wondering how hard one needs to throw to make it stick.

3. Make sense of the strange and incomprehensible and frightening.

4. Become able to support myself (and company) financially somehow and move to Sweden.

5. To live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and learn what the website had to teach--and not when I come to die discover I had not lived.
