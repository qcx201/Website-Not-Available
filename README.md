## Website Not Found
Welcome to the rambles of a sleepless sleepy nobody at 3:32 AM. Allow me to congratulate you on this meaningless though not non-existant milestone in your life.

This is the mission:
1. Learn how to make a website (cheaply, if possible)
2. Throw misguided, half-baked ideas unto a website--as one would throw unto the sink a cake made from scratch that came out of the oven suddenly disappointing, or would a wet wad of toilet paper onto the wall, wondering how hard one needs to throw to make it stick.
3. Make sense of the strange and incomprehensible and scared.
4. Become able to support oneself (and company) financially somehow and move to Sweden.
5. To live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and learn what the website had to teach--and not, when One comes to die, discover One has not lived.
