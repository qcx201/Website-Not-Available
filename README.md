## Website Not Available
Welcome to the rambles of a sleepless nobody at 3:32 AM. Allow me to congratulate you on this experience in your life that is completely meaningless and insigificant, though it is technically happening and perhaps even true...

This is the mission:

1. Learn how to make a website (cheaply, if possible).

2. Throw misguided, half-baked ideas unto a website--as one would throw a wad of wet paper onto the wall, curious at how hard one needs to throw to make it stick.

3. Make sense of the strange and incomprehensible and frightening.

4. Become able to support oneself (and company) financially and somehow move to Sweden.

5. To live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and learn what the website had to teach--and not when one comes to die discover one has not lived.
