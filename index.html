  <p>Welcome to the rambles of a sleepless sleepy nobody at 3:32 AM. Allow me to congratulate you on this experience in your life that is completely meaningless and insigificant, though it is technically happening and perhaps even true...</p>
  <p>This is the mission:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Learn how to make a website (cheaply, if possible).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Throw misguided, half-baked ideas unto a website--as one would throw a wad of wet paper onto the wall, curious at how hard one needs to throw to make it stick.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Make sense of the strange and incomprehensible and frightening.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Become able to support oneself (and company) financially and somehow move to Sweden.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>To live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and learn what the website had to teach--and not when one comes to die discover one has not lived.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
