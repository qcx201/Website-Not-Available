<h2> Website Not Available </h2>

Welcome to the rambles of a sleepless sleepy nobody at 3:31 AM. Allow me to congratulate you on this meaningless and insignificant, though technically true experience in your life. Yes, this moment is real and you are here.<br />
<div><br /></div>
 <div>This is the mission:</div>
<div>
  <ol>
    <li style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;Learn how to make a website (cheaply, if possible)</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">Throw misguided, half-baked ideas unto a website--as one would throw unto the sink a cake made from scratch that came out of the oven suddenly disappointing, or would a wet wad of toilet paper onto the wall, wondering how hard one needs to throw to make it stick.</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">Make sense of the strange and incomprehensible and scared.</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">Become able to support oneself (and company) financially somehow and move to Sweden.</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">To live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and learn what the website had to teach--and not, when One comes to die, discover One has not lived.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
