  <p>Welcome to the rambles of a sleepless sleepy nobody at 3:32 AM. Allow me to congratulate you on this event in your life that is technically happening and perhaps even true, though completely meaningless and insigificant.</p>

  <p>This is the mission:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Learn how to make a website (cheaply, if possible).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Throw misguided, half-baked ideas unto a website–as you would throw unto the sink a cake made from scratch that came out of the oven suddenly disappointing, or would a wet wad of toilet paper onto the wall, wondering how hard one needs to throw to make it stick.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Make sense of the strange and incomprehensible and frightening.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Become able to support myself (and company) financially somehow and move to Sweden.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>To live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and learn what the website had to teach–and not when I come to die discover I had not lived.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
